# EdgeEye-TinyML-Drowsiness-Detection-ESP32-Cam
EdgeEye is an end-to-end TinyML project designed to detect driver drowsiness in real-time. By utilizing an ESP32-CAM and a custom-trained object detection model via Edge Impulse, this system identifies eye states (Open/Closed) directly on the edge, ensuring low latency and data privacy.
